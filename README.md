Technical notes
---------------

- Git uses several special files to configure or to automate the work
  with the repository.  One such file is *.gitignore*.  It is used to
  specify [glob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming))
  patterns for the files it will never suggest to **stage**.
  Typically, you would list in it names of the files that are
  automatically generated when processing the source files stored in
  your repository.

    Example *.gitignore* may look like this:
    ```
    # Ignoring backup files generated by Emacs
    *~
    ```
